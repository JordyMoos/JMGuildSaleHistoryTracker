## JMGuildHistoryTracker

Addon for elder scroll online that keeps track of guild sales.
Other addons can request this addon about all the sales of a guild.
Or sales and buys from users or of a certain item id.

## Sale structure

```lua
sale =
{
    saleTimestamp = '',
    seller = '', -- The account name like @player
    buyer = '',
    quantity = '',
    itemLink = '',
    price = '',
    tax = '',
    itemId = '',
    guildName = '',
    isKioskSale = '', -- true or false
}
```

The addon also stores some information about the guild that the addon uses itself.
That information is also in the saved file. (See below)

## Guild information structure

    {
        -- Guilds are stored by their name

            name = '',
            description = '',

            memberList =
            {
                "@player" = "@Player",
                -- etc..
            },

            -- List of sales as described above
            saleList =
            {
