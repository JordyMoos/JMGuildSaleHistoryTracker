## JMGuildHistoryTracker

Addon for elder scroll online that keeps track of guild sales.
Other addons can request this addon about all the sales of a guild.
Or sales and buys from users or of a certain item id.

## Sale structure

```lua
sale =
{
    saleTimestamp = '',
    seller = '', -- The account name like @player
    buyer = '',
    quantity = '',
    itemLink = '',
    price = '',
    tax = '',
    itemId = '',
    guildName = '',
    isKioskSale = '', -- true or false
}
```

The addon also stores some information about the guild that the addon uses itself.
That information is also in the saved file. (See below)

## Guild information structure

```lua
data =
{
    guildList =
    {
        -- Guilds are stored by their name
        "Name of first guild" =
        {
            name = '',
            description = '',

            memberList =
            {
                "@player" = "@Player",
                -- etc..
            },

            -- List of sales as described above
            saleList =
            {
                sale,
                sale,
                sale,
            },
        },

        "Name of second guild" = {}, -- Etc..
    }
}
```

### checkVersion

```lua
---
--- @param atLeastVersion             Means that you need this addon be at least in the given version
--- @param lessThanVersion (optional) Means that the addon needs to be less than the given version
--- JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion(atLeastVersion, lessThanVersion)
---
--- If you do not assign the second argument than it will be automatically assigned to the next mayor version
--- For example if your atLeastVersion is 0.5 than the lessThanVersion will become 1.0
--- You can also set false to the second parameter and than there will be no check against the lessThanVersion version
---
--- Examples:
--- - Lets say that this currents addon version is 1.7 in all the examples then:
---
--- Will return true because 1.5.1 is less than 1.7 and not more than 2.0 (the next mayor)
local isCorrectVersion = JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion('1.5.1')
---
--- Exactly the same as the previous example
local isCorrectVersion = JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion('1.5.1', '2.0')
---
--- False: The current version is lower than what you require
local isCorrectVersion = JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion('1.7.1')
---
--- False: The current version is more than the next mayor
local isCorrectVersion = JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion('0.6.1')
---
--- True: The current version is between the asLeast and LessThan
local isCorrectVersion = JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion('0.6.1', '2.0')
---
--- True: We ignore the LessThan
local isCorrectVersion = JMGuildSaleHistoryTracker.checkVersion('0.6.1', false)

```
